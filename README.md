# one-wise

One-wise combinatorial testing generator

> A **1-wise** (*a.k.a.* **1-way**) testing generator guarantees that at least one value of each group appears in the generated tests. The produced array has exactly the length of the largest input array.

## About

This is a fast and simple implementation of a [1-wise testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pairs_testing) generator. No external dependencies. Uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Install

```bash
npm install one-wise --save
```

## Example


```javascript
import { oneWise } from 'one-wise';

console.log(
    oneWise( {
        "foo": [ "x", "y" ],
        "bar": [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ],
        "baz": [ "f", "g" ]
    } )
);
```
will print
```json
[
   { "foo": "x", "bar": "a", "baz": "f" },
   { "foo": "y", "bar": "b", "baz": "g" },
   { "foo": "x", "bar": "c", "baz": "f" },
   { "foo": "y", "bar": "d", "baz": "g" }
]
```
**Note**: the values of `foo` and `bar` in the last two lines are picked *randomly*.

It uses JavaScript's `Math.random()`, but a *predictive* pseudo-random generator function (*e.g.,* [seedrandom](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom)) can be passed as a second argument. Such function must work like `Math.random()` and return a number >= 0 and < 1.
```javascript
oneWise( { ... }, myPseudoRandomNumberGenerator );
```
